You'd get the advice of using Alfa adapters on most of the sites and videos. But the problem is that Alfa adapters are very expensive, ranging from ₹ 6,000 to ₹ 8,000. I use D-Link DWA-131 network adapter. It is a nice adapter. Has a range of about 40 meters, and supports monitor mode and wireless injection. Links to buy it on Amazon and Flipkart :
